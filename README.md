## Background

This project is intended to be used with the latest release of [Playwright test](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test).

Playwright is great for test automation this package is to make it even better with support for advanced request handling, mocking and some
element helper functions.


### Installation
```
$ npm install playwright-helpers --save-dev
```

### Package contents

Currently this package consists of the following helpers:

- MockHelper: for mocking endpoints and return predefined json
- RequestHelper: methods for waiting network requests 
- ElementHelper: methods for element interactions 

### Usage of the helpers in your playwright tests

##### Extend test with the helpers
```ts
import { test as base, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import { MockHelper, RequestHelper } from 'playwright-helpers';

export type TestOptions = {
  mockHelper: MockHelper;
  requestHelper: RequestHelper;
};

export const test = base.extend<TestOptions>({
  mockHelper: async ({ page }, use) => {
    use(new MockHelper(page, 'test/mocks'));
  },
  requestHelper: async ({ page }, use) => {
    use(new RequestHelper(page));
  }
});
```

##### Usage in your tests

```ts
test('my test', async ({ page, requestHelper }) => {
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
```

### MockHelper
Function for easy mock setup. You create a basedir to place your json mockfiles (in example below files are located in test/mocks folder) 

```ts
new MockHelper(page, 'test/mocks')
```

For each API endpoint you define a directory where you place your scenario files. In the code below the api mockDir is people and the scenario is 200-ok. 
This will return the 200-ok.json from location test/mocks/people

```ts
await mockHelper.mockEndpoint({
  mockDir: 'people', url: 'https://swapi.dev/api/people/.*'}, '200-ok')
```

### RequestHelper

Functionality like in Cypress where you can wait for intercept. First paramater is the regex url of the endpoint and second paramater is the action you want to perform.

```ts
  const result = await requestHelper.actionAndwaitForResponse(
    "indexes/.*/queries",
    page.type('.DocSearch-Input', 'network'));
```


All available methods can be found in the [documentation][docsRequestHelper]
